## 🎯 What is a Reverse Sales Tax Calculator?

A reverse sales tax calculator helps you find the **original price before tax** when you only know the final price (including tax). Unlike regular calculators that add tax to a base price, this tool works backward to reveal the pre-tax amount.

**Example:**
- You paid **$107.25** (final price with tax)
- Your local tax rate is **7.25%**
- Original price before tax: **$100.00**
- Tax amount paid: **$7.25**

## 📐 How It Works

### The Math Behind It

```
Original Price = Final Price ÷ (1 + Tax Rate/100)
Tax Amount = Final Price - Original Price
```

**Step-by-Step Example:**

1. Final Price: $86.40
2. Tax Rate: 8%
3. Convert to decimal: 8% = 0.08
4. Calculate divisor: 1 + 0.08 = 1.08
5. Original Price: $86.40 ÷ 1.08 = **$80.00**
6. Tax Amount: $86.40 - $80.00 = **$6.40**

Our calculator performs these calculations instantly with precision!
